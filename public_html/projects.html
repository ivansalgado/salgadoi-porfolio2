                    <p>I am currently working on a second portfolio. This portfolio (rather than my first portfolio)
                       was more enjoyable to create because of all of the "toys" I had 
                       access to with <a href="technology.html">Bootstrap</a>. However, having Bootstrap meant more 
                       coding as well. Overall, though, I enjoyed working on my second 
                       portfolio.</p>

                    <p>Portfolio 1 vs. Portfolio 2</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p>Although this is only my second portfolio, there is a very visible 
                           difference between the style of Portfolio 1 and the style of 
                           Portfolio 2. As I stated above, Bootstrap was very helpful in the 
                           process of creating my second portfolio as well as disadvantageous 
                           in the way that it required more complex coding. Portfolio 1 was
                           much easier to code than Portfolio 2, though Portfolio 2 looks
                           much more professional. But I guess it's beauty before pain, right?</p>
