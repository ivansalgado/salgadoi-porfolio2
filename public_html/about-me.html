                    <p>I'm a student at the App 
                    Academy at Pasadena High School. I am currently 
                    learning how to create a web site. It has only been six weeks 
                    since school started and I have already learned from so much from
                    both examples and mistakes! I am very interested in learning about
                    the development of computer/mobile applications. Among many other
                    careers, I have considered computer programming as something that
                    I'd like to pursue. I believe that this class will teach me all 
                    of the right steps to make my aspiration a reality.</p>
